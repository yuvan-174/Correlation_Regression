# Software required :  

Python

# Theory:

Correlation describes the strength of an association between two variables, and is completely symmetrical, the correlation between A and B is the same as the correlation between B and A. However, if the two variables are related it means that when one changes by a certain amount the other changes on an average by a certain amount.  

If y represents the dependent variable and x the independent variable, this relationship is described as the regression of y on x. The relationship can be represented by a simple equation called the regression equation. The regression equation representing how much y changes with any given change of x can be used to construct a regression line on a scatter diagram, and in the simplest case this is assumed to be a straight line.

# Program :

```py
import numpy as np
import math
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [int(i) for i in input("Enter x value: ").split()]
y = [int(i) for i in input("Enter y value: ").split()]

N = len(x)
Sx = 0
Sy = 0
Sxy = 0
Sx2 = 0
Sy2 = 0

for i in range(0, N):
    Sx = Sx + x[i]
    Sy = Sy + y[i]
    Sxy = Sxy + x[i] * y[i]
    Sx2 = Sx2 + x[i]**2
    Sy2 = Sy2 + y[i]**2

r = (N * Sxy - Sx * Sy) / (math.sqrt(N * Sx2 - Sx**2) * math.sqrt(N * Sy2 - Sy**2))
print("The Correlation coefficient is %0.3f" % r)

byx = (N * Sxy - Sx * Sy) / (N * Sx2 - Sx**2)
xmean = Sx / N
ymean = Sy / N

print("The Regression line Y on X is: y = %0.3f + %0.3f(x - %0.3f)" % (ymean, byx, xmean))

plt.scatter(x, y)

def Reg(x):
    return ymean + byx * (x - xmean)

x = np.linspace(20, 80, 51)
y1 = Reg(x)
plt.plot(x, y1, 'r')
plt.xlabel('x-data')
plt.ylabel('y-data')
plt.legend(['Regression Line', 'Data points'])

```
